# Complex Word Identification as a Sequence Labelling Task

This github contains the state-of-the-art complex word identification (CWI) models from Gooding and Kochmar (2019).

The sequence model used is available here: https://github.com/marekrei/sequence-labeler, please also cite this paper if using the CWI models in your research. 

In order to run the CWI models, you will need to download the original sequence labeller repository. Additional functions for the CWI models are available in complex_word.py. Please refer to the Example notebook for details on how to use the models.
